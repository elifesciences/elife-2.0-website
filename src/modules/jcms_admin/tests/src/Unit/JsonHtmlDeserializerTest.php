This step needs to be short-circuited only once with an update being applied only to the live site, then the pattern library and the live site would diverge.

          '<li>Take the time to agree your principles and build aims up front. Set the expectations that derive from these in the wider team, so no one’s surprised when you start challenging demands for moarLibrareez, etc.</li>',
          '<li>When following Atomic Design principles, don’t worry too much about strict molecule/organism hierarchy: get it as good as you can, but a slightly fuzzy but usable system is better than a system that’s strictly correct but horrible to use.</li>',
          '<li>Implementing a design system requires excellent communication between designers and front-end developers. A designer who understands front-end code, and developers with a design eye, both really help with this: the more shared context, the better the mutual understanding.</li>',
          '<li>Regularly review your process: if we hadn’t had the retrospective that uncovered the frustrations of the Product team over sign off, work quality could have been reduced and relationships strained.</li>',
          '<li>Don’t be afraid to iterate on the patterns and set the expectation early that this is a good thing. More complex patterns and/or patterns that have multiple variants may need a few shots at them to make them work. Remember that if you’re implementing a design system, the patterns don’t only have to work individually, but they have to be easily maintainable along with the design system. It’s worth spending more time to iterate to get it right at this stage, because fundamental changes later are bound to be more expensive in time, effort and complexity.</li>',
          '<li>Concentrating the design system typography in one place made thinking about it, talking about it and subsequently maintaining it a lot easier than it might otherwise have been.</li>',
          '<li>TDD FTW! The few times we didn’t use test-driven development for the JavaScript, it was always painful to fill in the gaps afterwards.</li>',
          '<li>Grunt is good to get up and running quickly for simple build pipelines, but if you’re trying to do more complicated things, it’s probably easier to use Gulp: Gulp build files are written in JavaScript, which is more versatile and less confusing than trying to wrangle a Grunt config JavaScript object for a complex build pipeline.</li>',
          '</ul>' . PHP_EOL,
          '<p>For the future, it’d be great to improve the JavaScript loader so that only the components on a particular page are loaded, and then initialisation can occur after these loads have completed.</p>' . PHP_EOL,
          '<p>Also, because we have a 1:1 relationship between JavaScript component and pattern, we should be able to support HTTP/2 delivery of individual JavaScript assets, only providing what is required to the client (once we’ve upgraded our CDN).</p>' . PHP_EOL,

          '<p>This is one of the most rewarding projects I’ve worked on: a truly honourable combination of open-source code enabling open-access science publishing. There’s loads more I could say, but this post is already long enough.
